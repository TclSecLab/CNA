# TSRC Vulnerability Disclosure Program

TCL highly values the security of its products and services, and is committed to developing secure and reliable products and ensuring user privacy protection. In the meantime, we’ve realized that security researchers play an important role in protecting TCL’s products and consumers, which is why the **TSRC (TCL Security Response Center) Vulnerability Disclosure Program** (hereinafter referred to as the Program) is developed. The Program provides a secure channel for researchers to report security issues of the Company and offers effective measures to triage and mitigate the security vulnerabilities. We are truly grateful to the researchers who followed the practice of responsible disclosure and did not disclose the vulnerabilities prematurely during the time required for issue resolution. Premature public disclosure of the vulnerabilities will put TCL users at higher risks. If you have identified any security vulnerabilities or issues in any domain names that belong to or relate to TCL, you are advised to report the vulnerabilities in the website of TSRC.

To protect our users, TCL will not disclose, discuss or confirm any security issues before a full investigation is completed with available updates.

Before you get into the details of the Program, please take a close look at the policies, terms, and conditions of the Program. If you disagree with the policies or terms of this program, you can exit the program and we will stop providing relevant services. If you continue to stay in the program, it means you fully understand and accept the following policies and terms.
