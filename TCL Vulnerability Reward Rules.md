# TCL Vulnerability Reward Rules
Effective Time: 2022-06-18 00:00 (UTC+8)——2025-12-31 00:00 (UTC+8）
## I. TCL Safety Reward Basic Principles
1. TCL hopes to strengthen its own business security and maintain user information security by submitting vulnerabilities by security enthusiasts in the industry, and welcomes feedback on TCL products or business security issues.

2. TCL opposes and condemns hackers who use vulnerability testing as an excuse to damage or harm the interests of the users.

3. If you have any suggestions on this process, please send an email to security@tcl.com to give us feedback. Once the suggestions are adopted, TCL will give corresponding rewards.

4. The reward program complies with the terms and contents described in the Terms and Conditions of the TCL Vulnerability Reward Program.

5. Please refer to the Privacy Statement of the TCL Vulnerability Reward Program for information on how TCL handles your personal data related to this reward program.

6. We ask you not to disclose the security vulnerabilities you reported before they are repaired (this includes any third party except you), otherwise you will no longer be able to participate in any existing or future vulnerability reward programs of TCL. If you plan to discuss the vulnerabilities publicly after we repair them, including conference speeches, publishing technical sharing articles, etc., please contact security@tcl.com in advance.

7. If the TCL vulnerability you found is not within the scope of this reward program, we will not pay the reward, but we will still deal with it according to the TCL vulnerability handling process, and hope that you will continue to cooperate with us for collaborative vulnerability disclosure.

8. If you disagree with anything in this rule, please do not send us any vulnerability report or participate in this program in other ways. Submitting any vulnerability to TCL or participating in the program in any way means that you accept all the contents of the Rules, TCL Vulnerability Reward Program Agreement, TCL Vulnerability Reward Program Privacy Guide, vulnerability reward program rules for specific products and any other applicable terms.
