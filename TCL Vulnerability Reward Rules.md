# TCL Vulnerability Reward Rules
Effective Time: 2022-06-18 00:00 (UTC+8)——2025-12-31 00:00 (UTC+8）
## I. TCL Safety Reward Basic Principles
1. TCL hopes to strengthen its own business security and maintain user information security by submitting vulnerabilities by security enthusiasts in the industry, and welcomes feedback on TCL products or business security issues.

2. TCL opposes and condemns hackers who use vulnerability testing as an excuse to damage or harm the interests of the users.

3. If you have any suggestions on this process, please send an email to security@tcl.com to give us feedback. Once the suggestions are adopted, TCL will give corresponding rewards.

4. The reward program complies with the terms and contents described in the Terms and Conditions of the TCL Vulnerability Reward Program.

5. Please refer to the Privacy Statement of the TCL Vulnerability Reward Program for information on how TCL handles your personal data related to this reward program.

6. We ask you not to disclose the security vulnerabilities you reported before they are repaired (this includes any third party except you), otherwise you will no longer be able to participate in any existing or future vulnerability reward programs of TCL. If you plan to discuss the vulnerabilities publicly after we repair them, including conference speeches, publishing technical sharing articles, etc., please contact security@tcl.com in advance.

7. If the TCL vulnerability you found is not within the scope of this reward program, we will not pay the reward, but we will still deal with it according to the TCL vulnerability handling process, and hope that you will continue to cooperate with us for collaborative vulnerability disclosure.

8. If you disagree with anything in this rule, please do not send us any vulnerability report or participate in this program in other ways. Submitting any vulnerability to TCL or participating in the program in any way means that you accept all the contents of the Rules, TCL Vulnerability Reward Program Agreement, TCL Vulnerability Reward Program Privacy Guide, vulnerability reward program rules for specific products and any other applicable terms.

## II. Vulnerability Submitting and Handling Processes

### 2.1 Submission Process

### 2.2 Common Vulnerability Scoring Rules

(1) For the same vulnerability, only the first reporter will be given appropriate rewards based on the following criteria, and other reports will be regarded as not conforming to the rules and will not be rewarded.

(2) Before the vulnerability was repaired, it was disclosed privately without TCL''s consent, TCL will not distribute rewards; TCL will have the right to pursue its legal responsibilities if it damages the privacy of users or other sensitive data and causes losses.

(3) Some vulnerabilities are technically feasible, but there is no report of in-depth proof. TCL security engineers will conduct internal tests to confirm the potential harm of vulnerabilities.

(4) Multiple vulnerabilities generated by the same vulnerability source count as one vulnerability, for example, if the port is open and there are multiple port opening problems, it can only count as one vulnerability.

(5) The vulnerability report should include a detailed vulnerability description, recurring poc and vulnerability hazard certificate to speed up the processing speed of technicians. Vulnerability reports that are too simple and without any proof of harm will be ignored or reduced in pay.

(6) For vulnerabilities that do not belong to TCL's own business, such as those of partner companies, we will actively communicate them to partner companies, and the vulnerabilities of partner companies will not be included in the rewards. Meanwhile, open source vulnerabilities are not in the reward, which include third-party components, Google Android environment and Linux kernel.

(7) TCL's final audit results of vulnerabilities will be comprehensively judged based on the difficulty of exploiting vulnerabilities, the degree of hazard and the scope of influence.

## III. Vulnerability Reward Composition

The reward consists of three parts: basic reward of vulnerability/intelligence, quality report bonus and special vulnerability/intelligence contribution reward, which will be continuously upgraded and improved according to the industry situation and the suggestions of vulnerability reporters.

### 3.1 Basic Reward of Vulnerability/Intelligence

See Chapter IV for basic reward

### 3.2 Bonus for Quality Reports

If the submitted report is detailed and complete, the reporter may receive the extra rewards of 10 to 1,00 US dollars. The report should include title+vulnerability description+vulnerability certificate+repair program. [Title]: Clarify the domain name and product name affected by the vulnerability and the type of vulnerability [Vulnerability Description]: Detailed vulnerability description, url, vulnerability parameters, etc. [Vulnerability Certificate]: vulnerability impact description and vulnerability utilization certificate [Repair Program]: Provide one or more executable repair suggestions for the reported vulnerabilities

### 3.3 Special Vulnerability/Intelligence Contribution Reward

For vulnerabilities/intelligence that has a great impact on TCL security, such as critically sensitive information disclosure, direct denial of service of TCL core business, remote access to core system authority, etc., TCL will give the extra rewards of 100$~10000$ after verification.

## IV. Security Vulnerability Scoring Rules

### 4.1 Vulnerability Basic Scoring and Reward Rules

We have defined four levels for vulnerabilities based on the degree of hazard: critical, high, medium, and low. The vulnerabilities covered by each level and the scoring standards are shown in the following table.

This scoring rule is only for reference, and the final scoring and reward quota of vulnerabilities will be comprehensively rated according to the actual utilization difficulty of vulnerabilities, business characteristics, the scope of vulnerability influence, the detailed degree of reports, and the cooperation degree of reporting persons during retest. TCL has the final interpretation and decision-making power.

#### Details of Scoring Rules

| Vulnerability level | Vulnerability details | Reward standards (￥) |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Critical | 1. Execute arbitrary code in TEE;<br>2. Access TEE-protected data without authorization (fingerprints, facial recognition, and payment data causing financial loss);<br>3. Execute arbitrary code in privileged processes or TCB/ICE;<br>4. Permanent denial-of-service attack resulting in device unusable, requiring full OS reflashing;<br>5. Bypass local authentication interaction requirements;<br>6. Bypass authentication mechanisms such as OPOP security lock screen;<br>7. Bypass local account identification to obtain images, voice, or personal privacy; | Core business: 7000-35000<br>General business: 3500-7000<br>Edge business: 1500-3500 |
| High | 1. Execute arbitrary code via remote process control;<br>2. Execute arbitrary code in normal process remotely;<br>3. Access TEE-protected data without authorization;<br>4. Attackers can access protected data (normally accessed by locally installed apps after approval, or privileged processes);<br>5. Temporary denial-of-service attack via remote trigger (hang or reboot device);<br>6. Bypass authorized local interaction requirements;<br>7. Bypass local authentication interaction requirements;<br>8. Bypass sandbox isolation protection, leaking sandboxed user or personal data;<br>9. Bypass local app startup protection;<br>10. Bypass call function protection;<br>11. Bypass SMS sending protection;<br>12. Bypass camera activation protection;<br>13. Bypass video recording protection; | Core business: 1400-7000<br>General business: 700-2100<br>Edge business: 420-700 |
| Medium | 1. Remote code execution in restricted processes;<br>2. Execute arbitrary code in normal process via local access;<br>3. Bypass mitigation techniques in privileged processes, TCB or TEE;<br>4. Access protected data without authorization;<br>5. Attackers can access protected data;<br>6. Bypass local authentication interaction requirements;<br>7. Bypass specific interaction verification during function calls;<br>8. Bypass app access authentication and security mechanisms; | Core business: 700-1400<br>General business: 420-700<br>Edge business: 70-140 |
| Low | 1. Execute arbitrary code via local process or procedure;<br>2. Bypass mitigation techniques or security mechanisms in non-privileged processes;<br>3. Bypass security mechanisms or protections of low privilege apps;<br>4. Cause information leakage; | Core business: 140-350<br>General business: 70-140<br>Edge business: 0-70 |

## V. Reward Allocation Instructions

(1) Overseas vulnerability reporters can obtain rewards by providing PayPal accounts. If it is other ways, TCL must confirm whether it can be paid. In China, it can be issued by the bank card number.

(2) The vulnerabilities you submit will be confirmed within 3 business days after receiving the report and the evaluation process will begin. A preliminary response will be provided within 7 business days. TCL endeavors to address vulnerabilities in accordance with industry-standard practices after receiving the report, with Critical-risk vulnerabilities being fixed within 15 business days. High-risk and Medium-risk vulnerabilities will be fixed within 90 business days, while Low-risk vulnerabilities will be fixed within 180 business days. Note: Some vulnerabilities are subject to environmental or hardware limitations, and the final resolution time will be confirmed based on the actual situation. However, due to the complexity of each vulnerability, the analysis difficulty is different, and there will be a longer cycle. Hope you can understand. If you can provide detailed POC, it will speed up the processing speed of staff. 

(3) The reward is distributed in two stages: 50% of the basic bonus will be distributed at the beginning of the first month after the vulnerability is graded, and the remaining 50% of the basic bonus and bonus for this vulnerability will be distributed after the vulnerability is repaired. Since different business repair cycles are different, we will inform the repair cycle length and the reward distribution time by stages.

(4) If the payment account number and other information are not filled in, the reward will be affected, and we will inform you of the supplementary payment information through security@tcl.com. Note: In the process of vulnerability handling, if the reporter disagrees with the handling process, vulnerability assessment, vulnerability scoring, etc., please give feedback through email security@tcl.com.
